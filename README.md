WalkieTalkie
============

The project we were writing during [What The Hack?](http://wth.by) hackathon.

We have won in nomination 'The most useless piece of code'. Because our WalkieTalkie was able to transfer voice data between devices without using Internet, and nicely animate button state, but it wasn't able actually to play it (haven't enough of time to debug the problem). So finally 4 developers during 44 hours have developed WalkitTalkie which doesn't allow to hear each other :)

But we all haven't developed anything in Swift before so it was really cool to start using swift at the hackathon!
